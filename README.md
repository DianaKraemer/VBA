#Excel Code

Example VBA code I wrote to make my life easier. 

In public safety, there are many radio channels and options. Please take a look at zone.PNG to see what the goal is.
This document is a handy reference for personnel to see what channels their radios have and what systems they're on. 
Making this document is a tedious process. After making a number of unnecessary mistakes, I decided to automate the 
process. I wanted to save time and eliminate as many errors as possible.  

Please note that there are some things that aren't able to be automated, namely the individual agency's channel names because those 
depend on what the agencies naming conventions are and any customizations that may be needed. 
          
This document automates a numbering system, coloring/formatting of the zone blocks and coloring/formatting of set channels, such as 
federal interoperability channels and other known constants for my area. 

Please feel free to download the Excel file. Push the button and watch the magic! 


Update uploaded 7/27/2020: Picking the project up again after a few months. The projects is moving towards the goal of handling more specific cases, such as the ones claimed above to not be automated due to individual agences naming conventions. After looking through previously created layouts from my coworkers, I've found there aren't many naming standards. This allows me to set my own standards, furthuring the functionality of my application. 
The difficulty in implementing these is that I am trying to eliminate pages of If/ElseIf checks/handling conditions.
