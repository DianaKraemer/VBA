# VBA
Example VBA code I wrote to make my life easier. 

In public safety, there are many radio channels and options. Please take a look at the example picture to see what the end goal is.
This document is a handy reference for officers to see what channels their radios have and what systems they're on. 
Making this document is a process that I find very tedious. After making a number of unnecessary mistakes, I decided to automate the 
process. I wanted to save time and eliminate as many errors as possible.  

Please note that there are some things that aren't able to be automated, namely the individual agency's channel names because those 
depend on what the agencies naming conventions are and any customizations that may be needed. 

This document automates a numbering system, coloring/formatting of the zone blocks and coloring/formatting of set channels, such as 
federal interoperability channels and other known constants for my area. 

Please feel free to download the Excel file. Push the button and watch the magic!
